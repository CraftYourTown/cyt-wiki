</details>

_Please note we do not enforce chat rules 1-3 in direct message logs without a report. If you are being harassed/insulted by another player via direct message in-game in an unsolicited or unwanted manner (e.g not just joking around with a friend), and they do not stop when asked, you should create a report in our Discord. If we find logs that show you have mute evaded in direct messages or any other chat channel, you will be punished for it whether the incident was reported by a player or not_

_If a player is targeted, bullied, harassed, or made to feel isolated in-game on CYT due to someone spreading misinformation/rumours/gossip about them outside of CYT official platforms (e.g gossiping on another Discord server, in private with other players etc), you will be punished accordingly for it. For example, if you spread harmful or defamatory misinformation about someone and encourage everyone to ignore them or outlaw them from your town, with the intent of trying to isolate them/make them have a bad experience, you will be held responsible for that harassment and be punished for it accordingly. If you have personal issues with another player and those issues do not break CYT rules, it is not your responsibility to spread those issues around - mind your own business, and let other people make their own decisions about someone. If those issues do break CYT rules, they will be dealt with accordingly by staff, and should not be discussed further than a report. This is a Minecraft server, a place to relax and have fun, not to spread hate!_
