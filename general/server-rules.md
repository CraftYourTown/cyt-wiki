#### 3. No Bug Abuse, Harassment, or Scamming

{% endhint %}

Using alternate accounts or exploiting bugs to evade punishments is prohibited.

#### 5. No Malicious Behavior

</details>

_Note_: Chat rules C1â€“C3 are not enforced in private messages unless reported. If harassed via private messages, report it on Discord if the behavior persists after asking the player to stop. Mute evasion in any chat channel will be punished, reported or not.

Keep personal disputes that donâ€™t break CYT rules private, and report rule-breaking issues to staff.
