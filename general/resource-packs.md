### **Want to enable our server's resource pack?**

Below are the instructions for enabling the server resource pack if you accidentally denied it originally, or you decide you want to enable it:

* Firstly, go to your server list, select CraftYourTown
* Press "Edit" at the bottom left
* Click "Server Resource Packs: Disabled" until it says "Server Resource Packs: Enabled"

And you're done - you'll be able to see all our custom textures such as cosmetics, custom mob drops, and much more!
