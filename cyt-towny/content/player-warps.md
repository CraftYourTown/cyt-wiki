### **What are Player Warps?**

Player Warps, commonly known as pwarp or PW, are player-made warps which allow other players to teleport to the location. Player Warps can be created at Rank II with the cost of £10,000 using /pw set \<name>. Make sure you are standing on the block you want your Player Warp spawn to be! Successfully created Player Warps will appear in /pw menu.

There is a limit to how many Player Warps that can be created by a player, which is based on their rank in /ranks:

* Rank II onwards: 1 Player Warps
* Rank VI onwards: 2 Player Warps
* Rank X onwards: 3 Player Warps
