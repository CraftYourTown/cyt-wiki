### **What are Player Warps?**

Player Warps, commonly known as pwarp or PW, are player-made warps which allows other players to teleport to the location. Player Warps can be created with the cost of £10,000 using /pw set \<name>. Make sure you are standing at the block you want your Player Warp spawn to be! Successfully-made Player Warps will appear in /pw.

There is a limit to how many Player Warps that can be created created by a player, which is based on their rank in /ranks:

* Rank II onwards: 1 PW
* Rank VI onwards: 2 PWs
* Rank X onwards: 3 PWs

Among the key commands to customise your player warp in /pw are:

* /pw desc set/remove \<warp> \<description> - Set/ remove descriptions.
* /pw icon set/remove \<warp> - Set/remove icon. Will use the item you are holding in your hand.
* /pw rename \<warp> \<newname> - Rename your warp (cost: £2500)
* /pw ban set/remove \<warp> \<player> - Ban/remove a banned player from your PW.

> Come visit my playerwarp!
>
> We sell everything you need!
