### **What are Daily Rewards?**

Daily Rewards is a system where you get rewarded for every day you log onto the server.

The Reward GUI can be opened by using /dr, /dailyr and and /dailyreward. Once the Reward GUI is opened, you'll be able to choose from 7 mystery items. Once you have claimed your reward, it will start a countdown from 24 hours until you can claim the reward for the next day.\
