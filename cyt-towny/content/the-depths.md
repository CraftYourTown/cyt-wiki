### What is The Depths?

The Depths is an intense game where players must venture deep into the abyss, battling fierce enemies and collecting valuable loot along the way. As players progress through each level, they must navigate the maze-like tunnels, while fending off relentless attacks from dangerous mobs that want nothing more than to kill you. Each level brings new challenges and tougher enemies, forcing players to constantly adapt and improve their skills. To succeed in The Depths, players must utilise a wide range of weapons and abilities, strategically selecting the best tools for each situation. The player can only hope that they have what it takes to reach the end of the Depths and leave victorious.

### Unlocking the Depths

Unlocking the Depths can be done by spending either £10,000 or using a Depths Key. The Depths will stay unlocked for 15 minutes from when it is opened, and once closed, will remain closed for 45 minutes. Entering the Depths can be done via the Depths NPC at **/warp Depths**. The Depths can only be entered once it has been unlocked. To enter, the player must either pay the £2,500 entry fee or use a Depths Entry Pass (obtainable from Depths Mobs, the [Depths Trader](the-depths.md#depths-trader) and as a reward from crates). The Depths can also be entered free of charge by using a [Warpstone](the-depths.md#warpstones).

The player will only be able to use what they bring in, and won't be able to use most commands, including /pv and /ec, and there are a range of items that can't be brought in the Depths too:

* Infected Eyes
* Void Lilies
* Tortured Totems
* Talismans
* Keys
* Pouches

### Warpstones

Warpstones are items that can be obtained from Depths Mobs, the Depths Trader and as a reward from crates. If the Depths is open, the Warpstone Altar (located at **/warp Depths**) can be used to teleport the player to a specific level within the Depths, depending on the type of warpstone used.

**Warpstone Types**

* **Ice Warpstone** - When used, will teleport the player to Level 3 of the Depths.
* **Prismarine Warpstone** - When used, will teleport the player to Level 6 of the Depths.
* **Purpur Warpstone** - When used, will teleport the player to Level 9 of the Depths.

### Leaving the Depths

To leave the Depths, you can either use /exit, reach the NPC at the end of each level or... die!

{% hint style="danger" %}
Be warned, using /exit or dying will result in any Infested Eyes, Void Lillies or Tortured Totems being lost. The only way to keep your loot and exit safely with it, is to reach the NPC at the end of a level and selecting the Leave Safely option.

### Goal of the Depths

#### Level 10 Multiplier

Once the player reaches the end of the Depths, they will be met with an NPC that has the ability to multiply the gained mob loot (Infected Eyes, Void Lilies and Tortured Totems) and allow the player to leave the Depths. The amount that drops are multiplied by is different every time the Depths are opened, and is stated when entering the Depths (in the Enter Depths GUI) and at the Level 10 NPC.

If the player reaches the end of the Depths and was also the one to unlock the Depths, as part of the [Unlock Perks](the-depths.md#unlock-perks), the player will receive an addition 0.5x multiplier of their loot.

### Obtainable Loot

* **Infected Eye**
* **Void Lily**
* **Tortured Totem**
* **Depths Key**
* **Depths Entry Pass**

### Depths Trader

The Depths Trader is an NPC located just next to the entrance to The Depths at **/warp Depths**. Each day, the trader has 7 items that can be obtained and refreshes its stock every 24 hours meaning that players can expect to see a different selection of items available for purchase each day they visit the store.

The only way to trade for the items the Depths Trader offers is by using Infected Eyes, Void Lilies and Tortured Totems, which all drop from mobs within The Depths.

Some items have player and global stock amounts. This means that some items can only be purchased a certain amount of times by the player or, if it's a global stock, can only be purchased a limited amount of times globally.
