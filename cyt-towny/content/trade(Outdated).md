### **What is Trading?**

By doing /trade , you will be able to Trade with another player. You can offer either items, money or XP in your trade, and once you both agree on what you are trading, you can click the red glass pane in the top left corner to make it green. Once both sides have done so, a countdown of 5 seconds will start, and thereafter you can close the GUI to get your items. If you wish to cancel your Trade before then, close the GUI by pressing Escape, and you will get your items back.
