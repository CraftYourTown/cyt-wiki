# Duels

### What are Duels?

Duels are a way to fight other players with either your own gear (without the risk of losing it) or with pre-set kits so you're all on the same playing field. The winner gets a certificate and their ELO for the kit used (except own gear) gets higher, whereas for the loser, theirs will get lower.

### How can I join a Duel?

You can either specifically request to duel a player using `/duel <player> [cash bet]` or join a queue to duel random players on either of the available kits at `/warp Duels`. The queues have a bet of Â£250, whereas you can choose not to specify a bet if you send a duel request to a player.
