### **What is PyroFishing?**

Tournaments are hourly events that happen on CYT that anyone can take part in, with a total of 3 tournaments taking place at any given time.

### What is Entropy?

Entropy is a currency used for Fishing. Its purpose is for purchasing Augments which are essentially Custom Enchantments for your fishing rod.

You can obtain Entropy by catching custom fish, gutting fish in the Gutting Station (**/fish gut**), completing Deliveries (**/fish deliveries**), using Entropy Crystals (items that store Entropy) or as a reward from various places such as the [Crates](crates.md) here on CYT!

### What are the Augments?

As explained above, Augments are Custom Enchantments specific to fishing rods.

{% hint style="info" %}
In-Game Command: **/fish augment** and **/fish augments**
{% endhint %}

To obtain an augment, there are two ways you can do this!

Firstly, you can uncover a Mystery Augment, an item obtained as a prize from Daily Rewards, Crates, Envoys and many more places. A Mystery Augment will turn into any of the 12 augments available!

Secondly,  you can crate augments using the exact crafting ingredients for that augment need to be thrown into a full cauldron and hit with a fishing rod. The items will combine and the augment will be have been crafted.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Be sure that you have the required fishing level (**/fish stats**), entropy (**/fish stats**) and exact ingredients when combining to make your augment!
{% endhint %}

To apply an augment to your fishing rod, use the command **/fish augment**, place your fishing rod in the left slot (this can be done by shift-clicking the rod in your inventory), and the augment you wish to put onto the rod next to it. Then click the green panel to the right, which will confirm the combination and give you back your fishing rod with the newly added augment!
