### **What are Cosmetics?**

Here on CYT, we offer the ability to obtain Cosmetics, and on V10, we have our very own Clover Crate dedicated to them! Cosmetics can also be obtained by other means, such as by completing fossil collections, Seasonal Crates and other Events. The Cosmetics are made to spruce up your builds or to show off your style! To wear a Cosmetic, type /hat when holding it, and to place it on a block, put it in an item frame or make an Armour Stand hold it!
