### **What are Tasks?**

One of our features on CYT is to complete Tasks, and this is also needed in order to rank up! There are 494 tasks in total within 23 different categories, and to start a task, you need to select it first. Players are limited to having 3 active tasks at a time, although if you decide you would rather complete another one, you can always deselect a task by right clicking on it again, however, do keep in mind that all progress within that task will be lost.

There are 10 different Task Levels, and for each level completed, you will gain a Tag and other rewards, which can be seen in the Task Rewards menu.
