### **What is mcMMO?**

One of the features of CYT is mcMMO, which is a plugin that gives you extra abilities for doing different skills. For a better understanding of the plugin and all its features, we have made a GUI that explains each skill and how increasing your level will give you extra abilities within that skill. By clicking on each skill in the GUI, you will get a bunch of information regarding your ability within that skill, and all the features of each skill and at what level you obtain it is also explained. If you right click on a skill, a leaderboard within that skill is shown instead, which tells you who’s in the lead and how many mcMMO levels they have within that skill.
