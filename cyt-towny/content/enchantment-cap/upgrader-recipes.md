## Upgrade & Repair Prices

#### Max level means max level of that tier, for example max level for efficiency will be 10, max level for feather falling will be 7. Therefore max level -1 is that enchantâ€™s maximum level -1, so for efficiency it would be efficiency 9 and for feather falling it would be level 6.

**Repair will be half the maximum amount of upgrade items needed to upgrade to that level rounded up, and there will be no break chance (for example, a broken efficiency 8 book will use half the amount of items needed to get from efficiency 7 to efficiency 8, which is 12 items, so 6 items are required to fix with no break chance).**
