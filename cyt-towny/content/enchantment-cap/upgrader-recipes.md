## Upgrade & Repair Prices

#### Max level means max level of that tier, for example max level for efficiency will be 10, max level for feather falling will be 7. Therefore max level -1 is that enchantâ€™s maximum level -1, so for efficiency it would be efficiency 9 and for feather falling it would be level 6.

Repair will be half the maximum amount of coins needed to upgrade to that level rounded up, and there will be no break chance (for example, a broken efficiency 8 book will use half the amount of coins needed to get from efficiency 7 to efficiency 8, which is 12 coins, so 6 coins are required to fix with no break chance).
