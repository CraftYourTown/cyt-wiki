### **What is CraftYourGadgets?**

CraftYourGadgets, or CYG, is a new custom-made plugin that we're excited to be showcasing here on CYT. The purpose of CYG is to offer a more enhanced multiplayer experience by offering a range of tools, machines, and items that benefit any play style. Whilst the list of currently available items is short, we have plans and the capability to mold CYG into something special.

### What does CYG add?
