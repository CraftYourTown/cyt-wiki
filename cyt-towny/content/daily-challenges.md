# Daily Challenges

## What are Daily Challenges?

Each day, you'll have **3** easy, **2** medium and **1** hard challenge to complete.\
You can view these by doing `/challenges`.

You can see both your progress & percent complete of each challenge by typing the `/challenges` command.

{% hint style="info" %}
Challenges reset each day at **10pm** BST or GMT (depending on whether daylight saving is in effect).
{% endhint %}

You are rewarded for completing each challenge as well as a separate reward once you've completed all of the challenges.

Rewards for completing challenges vary.
