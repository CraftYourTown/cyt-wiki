# Plot Types

We've had a few questions on what the plot types mean, so this is here to clean that up!

To set a plot to a type, you can do **/plot set \<type name>**. The **\<type name>**'s are listed below.

{% hint style="warning" %}
It costs **$500** from the town bank to set a plot type.

**Arena** - PVP is on all the time in arena plots as well as friendly-fire damage. Town health regen is also disabled in arena plots.

**Bank** - A plot designed for **/t deposit** & **/t withdraw** commands. Not required on CYT as we don't force the use of these for these commands.

**Embassy** - Allows outsiders from other towns to claim a plot in your town.

**Farm** - Allows players to kill animals, break and place crops, leaves and bee hives.

**Inn** - An Inn plot allows anyone to use a bed to set their **/res spawn** and spawn on death. The Inn plot will still deny a player who is in a nation declared as an enemy by your nation.

**Jail** -  Mayors and police can jail and unjail residents by typing **/town toggle jail \<player>**. Jailed residents will be sent to a jail plot if one exists.

**Outpost** - A town claim away from your main town area.

**Shop** - Allows the use of Chest Shops to be built on these.

**Wilds** - Designates a semi-protected wilderness plot, where trees, flowers, mushrooms etc can be broken but all other blocks cannot.

### Identifying a Plot

To find out what type a plot is, you first need to know what a plot is. **1 plot = 1 chunk**.&#x20;

You can enable viewing chunk borders by pressing **F3+G** on Windows, and **CMD+F3+G** on Mac. Then you'll need to do **/towny map big** and that'll pop up with a list of plots (chunks) nearby and a key to identifying them.&#x20;

For example, a green $ would indicate a plot for sale in your town that you can buy, whilst a white $ would indicate a plot that's for sale in a different town.

To purchase a plot, simply stand on a plot that is for sale and type **/plot claim**.
