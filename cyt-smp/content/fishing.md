{% hint style="info" %}
In-Game Command: **/fish menu** or **Shift-Right-Click** with a fishing rod in your hand.
{% endhint %}

### **What is PyroFishing?**

PyroFishing is a custom plugin that revamps Minecraft fishing. It adds new fish, custom fishing enchantments called **Augments**, a unique fishing-specific currency called **Entropy**, and custom mobs like **Crabs**.

### What are the new fish?

Currently, there are 201 custom fish divided into 6 tiers of rarity.

* **Bronze**
* **Silver**
* **Gold**
* **Diamond**
* **Platinum**
* **Mythical**

Out of the 201 custom fish, 35 require special bait to catch (**/fish bait**).

* **Jellyfish Bait**
* **Catfish Bait**
* **Shark Bait**
* **Ray Bait**
* **Eel Bait**

Some fish can only be found in specific biomes. To see a complete list of fish, their rarities, required baits, and what biomes they are located in, use **/fish codex**.

### What is Entropy?

Entropy is a currency used for Fishing. Entropy can be used to buy upgrades and augments.

You can obtain Entropy by catching custom fish, gutting fish in the Gutting Station (**/fish gut**), completing Deliveries (**/fish deliveries**), using Entropy Crystals (items that store Entropy) or as a reward from various places such as the [Crates](../../cyt-towny/content/crates.md) here on CYT!

### What are the Augments?

As explained above, Augments are Custom Enchantments specific to fishing rods.

{% hint style="info" %}
In-Game Command: **/fish augment** and **/fish augments**
{% endhint %}

There are two ways you can obtain augments

Firstly, you can uncover a Mystery Augment, an item obtained as a prize from Daily Rewards, Crates, Envoys, and many more places. A Mystery Augment will turn into any of the 12 augments available!

Secondly, you can create augments by throwing the required ingredients for a given augment into a full cauldron and hitting it with a fishing rod. The items will combine and the augment will have been crafted.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Be sure that you have the required fishing level (**/fish stats**), entropy (**/fish stats**), and the exact ingredients when making your augment!
{% endhint %}

To apply an augment to your fishing rod, use the command **/fish augment**, place your fishing rod in the left slot (this can be done by shift-clicking the rod in your inventory), and the augment you wish to put onto the rod next to it. Then click the green panel to the right, which will confirm the combination and give you back your fishing rod with the newly added augment!

There are 12 different Augments available to be crafted and all can be applied to your fishing rod at once, to view these augments in-game, use the command **/fish augments**. They're also listed here:
