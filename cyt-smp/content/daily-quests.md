# Daily Quests

## What are Daily Quests?

Each day, you'll have **3** easy, **2** medium and **1** hard Quest to complete.\
You can view these by doing `/dailies`.

You can see both your progress & percent complete of each Quest by typing the `/dailies` command.

You can reroll your Quests 1 time for Â£250, as long as no progress has been made on any Quest.

{% hint style="info" %}
Quests reset each day at **10pm** BST or GMT (depending on whether daylight saving is in effect).
{% endhint %}

You are rewarded for completing each Quest as well as a separate reward once you've completed all of the Quests.

Rewards for completing Quests vary.
