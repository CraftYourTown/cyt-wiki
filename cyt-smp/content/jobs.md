### **How do I do my Job?**

Check your **/jobs info** to see what you can do within your job and what pays the best - this could include breaking blocks, crafting items, killing mobs, harvesting crops and more. You can do your job anywhere in the Towny worlds. Any XP earned from your job will be automatically granted though to claim income from your job, visit the **/warp Bank** and talk to the Jobs NPC!

### What is the Money and XP Limit?

From when you begin actions of your joined jobs, a limit is set. For money, this is Â£25,000 per 24 hours and for Jobs XP, this is 20,000 per 24 hours. Check this limit and whether or not you are close it to by typing **/jobs limit**.

### How many Jobs can I have?

All players start with a max of **1** job, you can increase this by ranking up.\
Check out **/ranks** for more info.

### How do I leave a Job?

To leave a job, type **/jobs leave \<job name>** or to leave all joined jobs, type **/jobs leaveall**.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Leaving a job will result in 60% of your levels in that job being lost! For example, if you are Level 100 in Miner job and decide to leave the Miner job, if you join back, you will now only be Level 40 in Miner.
