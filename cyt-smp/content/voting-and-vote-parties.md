# Voting & Vote Parties

{% hint style="info" %}
In-Game Command: **/v** & **/voteparty**
{% endhint %}

Voting is by far the easiest and quickest way to get money - you can do this daily!

### What are Vote Parties?

On CYT, you have the ability to Vote for the server to support us, and in return, you will gain Vote Tokens! Use these by typing **/warp VoteShop** and spend them at the trader!

Once you have voted, you can stay online for the opportunity of entering VoteParties. These happen for every 75 votes on the server, and everyone who has voted will gain a VoteParty Pouch!
