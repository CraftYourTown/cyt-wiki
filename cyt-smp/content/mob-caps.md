### **What are Mob Caps?**

Mob Caps are limits on mobs in an area that we don't allow to be exceeded. Mobs that are name-tagged are exempt from the cap.

We have Mob Caps to prevent TPS drops, so that our server can remain fair and playable for all. Mobs are capped in groups, not per mob. Below you can see each **group of mobs**, and how many each group is capped to:

{% hint style="warning" %}
Mob Caps are not per-chunk, in the X/Z direction (like a circle), but a **16 block radius**; this is the same size as a chunk, but the borders may differ
