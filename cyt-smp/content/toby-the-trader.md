# Toby the Trader

### Who is Toby the Trader?

Toby the Trader is an NPC at spawn who will both sell you items and buy items from you. Some of the items he will buy from you are mob drops, animal drops, mining drops and farming drops for.

### How does Toby's Enchantment Trades work?

After the servers daily reboot, Toby will have 7 new enchantment books for sale that players can buy. These enchantments can range from vanilla max but can also go above the vanilla max ([enchantment-cap.md](enchantment-cap.md "mention")). The more the enchantment book goes above the vanilla's maximum level, the more money it will cost.

{% hint style="warning" %}
All books have a stock of **3** after they reset at **midnight (12am)** BST/GMT (depending on whether daylight saving is in effect). Ensure you are early to ensure you get the books you need!
{% endhint %}

### How does Toby's claimblock and misc section work?

You can also purchase claimblocks and miscellaneous items from Toby the Trader; unlike his enchantment trades, they are **unlimited** and set at a fixed rate. You can view those by heading to `/toby`, and clicking 'Buy Items' -> Purchase Claim Blocks or Miscellaneous.
