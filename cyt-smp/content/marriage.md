## What is marriage?

Marriage is a purely ceremonial in-game event triggered by players in our church or in their own building.

### How do you get married?

To get married, you need two players and a Priest (all must be within 20 blocks of each other). The priest should then run `/marry <player1> <player2>` and then needs to select the positions where player1 and player2 will stand by typing `/marry pos1` and `/marry pos2` . The Priest will then be instructed to repeat a short script and the players to marry will have to say 'I do' or 'I do not' when prompted.

### How do you become a Priest?

To become a Priest, you need to be an Obsidian (Towny) or Dolphin (SMP) rank member. You can then head to `/warp church` and speak to the Priest on the left to be sworn in.
