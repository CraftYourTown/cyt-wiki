### What are the Parkours?

Here on CYT, we offer you the chance to complete Parkour courses for rewards! You can either complete the Traditional courses or the Custom ones. When trying out the custom ones, we recommend that you complete the Tutorial to get to know how it works! You can also right click in the GUI on the different courses to check who has completed them the fastest!
