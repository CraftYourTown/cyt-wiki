# Player Market

### What is the Player Market?

The player market is the centre of the economy, it's where players trade, sell and buy from eachother.

### How do I get a market stall or plot?

You can buy a market stall or plot by clicking the sign on the left side of the stall or plot. The cost shown is a weekly cost taken from your cash, ensure you have enough each week or it will be removed and reset.

All plots start blank and you have the freedom to build your own store, whereas with a stall there's a prebuilt small structure you have to keep confined into.

If you can't afford your plot or stall each week, it will be reset and all items in will be lost. Ensure you leave enough cash in your balance to pay for it.
