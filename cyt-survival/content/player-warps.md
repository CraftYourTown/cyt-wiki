### **What are Player Warps?**

Player Warps, commonly known as pwarp or PW, are player-made warps which allows other players to teleport to the location. Player Warps can be created **for free** using /pw set \<name>. Make sure you are standing at the block you want your Player Warp spawn to be! Successfully-made Player Warps will appear in /pw.

Everyone gets **1** player warp.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you're inactive for **14 days** your warp will be **deleted**.

### **Player Warp Commands**

Among the key commands to customise your player warp in /pw are:

* /pw desc set/remove \<warp> \<description> - Set/ remove descriptions.
* /pw icon set/remove \<warp> - Set/remove icon. Will use the item you are holding in your hand.
* /pw rename \<warp> \<newname> - Rename your warp (cost: £2500)
* /pw ban set/remove \<warp> \<player> - Ban/remove a banned player from your PW.

**Note:** Adding \n into a chunk of text will move the following text to a new line, for example, typing, “Come visit my playerwarp!\nWe sell everything you need!” will appear in the PW menu as:

> Come visit my playerwarp!
>
> We sell everything you need!
