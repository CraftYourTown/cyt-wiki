## What is the Wizard?

The Wizard is your go-to to upgrade your heirlooms, acquire better tools and get rid of the useless ones hanging around.

### What is an Heirloom?

A heirloom is a tool that randomly generates with a unique name, enchants, modifiers, and has a respective tier. You will likely stumble on lots of these, although the higher tier ones are rare and do not drop naturally. You cannot pick what the item type is, nor it's enchants, modifiers, or name.

### Scrapping Heirlooms

All heirlooms can be scrapped into their respective scrap form, for example a Common Heirloom will become a Common Scrap. You can use several of these to upgrade to a higher tier scrap, which when obtained multiple, can be used to purchase Heirlooms. You can also use these to buy the same tier should you not wish to upgrade them.

### Upgrading Scraps

Scraps can be upgraded to the next tier to allow you to then purchase the higher tiered Heirlooms. Below is a table of what's needed.

| Tier      | Next Tier | Required          |
| --------- | --------- | ----------------- |
| Common    | Uncommon  | 10 Common Scraps  |
| Uncommon  | Rare      | 9 Uncommon Scraps |
| Rare      | Epic      | 8 Rare Scraps     |
| Epic      | Legendary | 7 Epic Scraps     |
| Legendary | N/A       | N/A               |

### Trading Scraps to Heirlooms

Scraps can easily be converted into an Heirloom. Below is a table of what's required.

| Tier      | Required           |
| --------- | ------------------ |
| Common    | 10 Common Scraps   |
| Uncommon  | 9 Uncommon Scraps  |
| Rare      | 8 Rare Scrapas     |
| Epic      | 7 Epic Scraps      |
| Legendary | 5 Legendary Scraps |

### How to use the GUI

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (19).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

To use the above GUI, all you simply need to do is place what you're looking to trade in the left blue box and press the green checkmark. Do not place anything in the green box as this is the output.

It will not let you scrap or trade anything you're not meant to, and will inform you if the quantity is incorrect.
