# Enchant Upgrading & Traders

### What are the Traders?

The traders are 6 NPCs in the server spawn that sell enchantment books for certain drops and experience levels.

The available trades are selected randomly from a preset pool and change daily at **10pm UTC**.

The cost of the enchantment books increases throughout the day with each sale. Be early to get the best deals.

Each available trade has a global stock amount, as well as limits on how many books each player can buy (per item).
