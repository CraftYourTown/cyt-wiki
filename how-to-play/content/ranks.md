### What are ranks?

Ranks are divided into two separate categories, free and premium.

### In-game Rankups

We offer an in-game way of leveling up and showing your progress, every player starts at level 1 and can work towards level 10 by completing objectives.

Check out `/ranks` in-game and click "In-game Rankups" to check it out!

### Store Ranks

These ranks are acquired with coins which can be purchased on the [Store](https://store.craftyourtown.com).
