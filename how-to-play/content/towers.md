### What are the Towers?

The Towers consist of the Angel, Demon, and Sculk Towers, three unique PVE (Player versus Environment) mini-games within CYT's Towny.

To progress within each tower, you need to kill the boss of the level. There are currently **5** levels and each get more difficult with more mobs, damage, knockback resistance and health. Within each level there are **5** waves of 'Minions' that will spawn to help defend the boss, if the boss is killed prior to all waves being completed, the waves are stopped for that level.

Once the boss is killed, the minions will despawn and you'll progress to the next level.

### Good to know

Here are some things you'll want to keep in mind:

1. The boss's health will scale based on playercount and will also decrease when a player dies
2. The amount of minions that spawn will scale based on playercount (only on waves)
3. Everyone in the arena gets drops from the boss every **10%** the boss's health decreases, these go directly into your inventory
4. Each level you progress, the amount of drops from both minions and the boss increases by **5%**
5. There can only be one instance of each tower running at a time, if it is in progress you must wait until it is empty. It will broadcast when it is available
6. Waves occur every **15** seconds with increasing mob counts
