<summary>Knowing Prices</summary>

Trying to think of what to sell an item for?\
It's difficult, so we made a custom plugin that averages prices out.

**Holding an item**\
If you're wanting to sell an item that you're holding, simply type **/iworth hand** and the plugin will return the average price of it. If it hasn't been sold before, this sadly won't be of any help.

**Want to search? No problem.**\
This plugin also has a search feature! Simply type **/iworth search \<item-name>** This works with custom items, crate keys, basically everything.

**Want to just look at every item ever sold? No problem.**\
Simply type **/iworth all** and there you go!

**How does it work?**\
It takes all sales of all items from both Auction House and Chest Shops and averages it out.

### **What is the Auction House?**

The Auction House is the best place to sell items that you may not want to make an entire shop or Player Warp for - to access it, simply type **/ah** in-game to see a list of all current listings.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you want to sell something on the Auction House, you will have to pay **£100** to put the item on there, as well as a **15% tax** on the item once it is sold (the same as chest shops)
{% endhint %}

### **How does it work?**

Simply hold what you're trying to sell, and type **/ah sell \<price>**; a confirmation will appear in chat letting you know about the £100 fee, and you'll have to type the command again to confirm you're happy to spend that cost. Auctions stay on **/ah** for 48h until going into the **"Expired Auctions"** section

### **Can I collect my expired items?**

Yes! Type **/ah** in-game, and click on the beacon labelled **"My Auctions"**. Afterwards, click on the enchanted clock labelled **"Expired Auctions"** and all your expired items will be there - click them with a free inventory slot to retrieve them!

### **How do I get more slots?**

Slots are obtained from purchasing donator ranks (click [**here**](https://store.craftyourtown.com/) to visit the store, or use **/store** in-game) or ranking up in-game using **/ranks**.
