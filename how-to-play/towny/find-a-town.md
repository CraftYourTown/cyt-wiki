# Find a Town

If you're new to the server or just looking for a change, there's a few options you have to find a town to join.

### Option 1: Town RTP

**Commands:**

```
/town rtp - teleport to a random plot.
/town rtp -ignore - teleport without a cost warning.
/town rtp -autojoin - auto join the town while you teleport to it.
```

**This option will teleport you to a town that fits the following criteria:**

* You are not an outlaw of the town
* The town is public
* The town is open to join
* The town has a plot free for you to claim (as that's where it will teleport you)

{% hint style="info" %}
**For town mayors:** Should you meet the above criteria, you'll automatically be added to the random teleport pool
{% endhint %}

You can then type `/town join <town name>` followed by `/plot claim` to claim the plot you were teleported on to if you like the look of the town.

### Option 2: Look through open towns manually

**Command:** `/opentowns`

If you don't fancy the random selector, you can always opt to look at towns yourself, after all nobody knows what you want better than you.

Type `/opentowns` to view a list of all of the server's available open towns.\
You can then do `/town spawn <town>` for each of them to check them out.

### Option 3: Check the Discord Server

**Command:** `/discord`

A lot of towns are advertised in our discord as a way to attract new members, check out our #towny-recruiting channel for any you like the look of.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
The towns shown here do not have to be open so you may not be able to teleport or view them immediately. Messaging the OP may be required.
{% endhint %}

### Option 4: Ask in the Server Chat

If all else fails or you prefer this method, go ahead - we won't judge.
